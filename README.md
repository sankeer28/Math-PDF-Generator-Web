# Math-PDF-Generator-Web
Live web version of the Math PDF Generator I made in Python
 It allows you to generate any number of PDFs (limited to your hardware specs), each containing random math problems and corresponding answer key. The PDFs are then packaged into a zip file and downloaded to your device.

## Features

- Generate set number of PDFs at a time
- Each PDF contains random math problems and answers
- PDFs are packaged into a zip file for easy download
- Works on both desktop and mobile devices

## Usage
Visit [site](https://sankeer28.github.io/Math-PDF-Generator-Web/)
Simply enter the number of PDFs  you want to generate and click the "Generate" button. The PDFs will be generated and automatically downloaded as a zip file.

## Limitations

The maximum number of PDFs you can generate is limited to your device. Generating a large number of PDFs can be resource-intensive and may cause your browser to become unresponsive.
