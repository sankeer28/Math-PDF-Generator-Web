# Math-PDF-Generator-Web
Live web version of the Math PDF Generator I made in Python
 It allows you to generate up to 50 PDFs at a time, each containing random math problems. The PDFs are then packaged into a zip file and downloaded to your device.

## Features

- Generate up to 50 PDFs at a time

Simply enter the number of PDFs  you want to generate and click the "Generate" button. The PDFs will be generated and automatically downloaded as a zip file.
