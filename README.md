Live web version of the [Math PDF Generator I made in Python](https://github.com/sankeer28/Math-PDF-Generator)
 . It allows you to generate any number of PDFs, each containing random math problems and corresponding answers. The PDFs are packaged into a zip file and downloaded to your device using jsZIP, jsPDF and FileSaver.js. My version of the [Course Hero File Generator](https://herogeneratorpure.com/) that runs locally.

## Features

- Generate any number of PDFs
- Each PDF contains random math problems and answers
- PDFs are packaged into a zip file for easy download
- Works on both desktop and mobile devices
- Each PDF has 10 pages 
- Random file names

## Usage
Visit [site](https://sankeer28.github.io/Math-PDF-Generator-Web/)
Simply enter the number of PDFs  you want to generate and click the "Generate PDFs" button. The PDFs will be generated and automatically downloaded as a zip file.

## Limitations

Generating a large number of PDFs can be resource-intensive and may take longer.
- 1000 PDFs took ~13 seconds | ZIP file size: 54.9 MB
- 5000 PDFs took ~1 minute after 2 "This page isn't responding" popups | ZIP file size: 274 MB | (why do you need this many)
  
## Next Steps
- Nicer PDF formatting
- more advanced equations (user is able to select different grade levels)
- Custom equations (user inputs format, numbers are randomized)
- Custom number of equations per PDF
